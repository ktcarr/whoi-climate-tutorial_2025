The goal of this tutorial is to learn how to assess or "diagnose" climate variability from a set of observations, reanalysis data, or climate model output. In practice, this means computing the statistics for a given variable (e.g., temperature in Woods Hole) over a given time period. In the tutorial, we'll start by going through an example together, assessing temperature variability in Woods Hole, based on model output from the CESM2 climate model. Then, you'll pick a region/variable and do the same type of analysis. This will lead directly into the first assignment, where you'll evaluate how well the CESM model represents climate variability in your specific region ("model validation").
