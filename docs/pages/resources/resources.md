## Links to useful resources

- [Ryan Abernathey's online book, "An introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science"](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html). This book covers much of what we'll cover in the tutorial in more detail. It also explains many fundamental topics for data science that we'll skip over (e.g., intro to command line and Git).
- [Patrick Mineault's Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/index.html#). This handbook is useful for "cleaning up" your code and structuring projects in more organized way.
