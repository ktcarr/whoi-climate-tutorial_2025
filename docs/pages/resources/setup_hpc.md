# High-performance computing

## HPC @ WHOI
To speed up analysis in the tutorials, you can run the Jupyter notebooks on WHOI's HPC system, called "Poseidon" (to use Poseidon, you may need to email IS to request an account). For instructions on setting up Jupyter on Poseidon, see [2024 tutorial by JP students Anthony Meza and Katy Abbott](https://github.com/anthony-meza/PO_HPC_Workshop).

## HPC @ National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
If you'd like to do more analysis after the tutorial, and the data you need isn't on WHOI's servers, it may be worth requesting a [Data Analysis Allocation](https://ncar-hpc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/allocations/university-allocations/#data-analysis-allocations-new) on NCAR's data analysis HPC, called "Casper". One advantage of using NCAR's system is that NCAR has much more data than WHOI has (e.g., the [multi-model large ensemble archive](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/d651039/)). Note that applying for an allocation requires writing a mini project proposal (basically, "what do you want to use the HPC for?") and requires a scientist/professor as a sponsor.
