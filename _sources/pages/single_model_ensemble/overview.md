# 4) Single-model ensemble 

The goal of this tutorial is to improve understanding of climate modes and how to study them using an ensemble of climate simulations. In Assignment 3 you'll be analyzing a particular climate mode using (part of) the CESM large ensemble. In the tutorial, we'll focus on an example mode, the El Niño - Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We'll start by recapping the physics of ENSO before digging into *how* to analyze ENSO in the ensemble of simulations. We'll look at how to compute/plot spatial and temporal characteristics of ENSO and assess how these characteristics change over time.  

## Data access
The CESM large ensemble data is located at the following directory on the CMIP6 server:
```python
cmip6/data/cmip6/CMIP/NCAR/LENS
```

```{note}
The CMIP6 server is located on Poseidon in the directory ```/vortexfs1/share```.
